# Adjust Coding Task

> Go application for Adjust case study. I've tried to keep everything simple.

It is pretty simple to run this app, just clone this repository and simply use;

    go run main.go

For running the tests with coverage (74.4% coverage as main function is not covered)

    go test -cover -v

I've covered every function for my unit tests except main function which is not needed for unit tests.
